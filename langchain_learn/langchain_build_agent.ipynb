However, I can give you an estimated weather forecast based on the average conditions for your region.\\n\\nAccording to the Weather Channel, the average temperature in San Francisco during March to May ranges from 57°F (14°C) to 81°F (27°C), with mild winters and hot summers. In March, temperatures tend to be slightly lower than usual due to higher humidity and cloud cover, while in April to May, the weather gradually warms up with an increase in sunlight.\\n\\nFor outdoor activities such as walking, biking, or hiking, the chances of encountering rain in the spring months (March to May) are typically lower, with fewer days experiencing precipitation compared to winter. However, it's essential to keep an eye on weather alerts and forecasts as they can change frequently, especially during peak season.\\n\\nIf you're interested in getting an idea of what the current weather might be like in San Francisco, you can check the official website of the San Francisco Department of Public Utilities or use a mobile app that provides real-time updates on weather conditions. Alternatively, if you prefer more detailed historical weather records, you can consult historical weather data available through APIs like OpenWeatherMap or AccuWeather, which may offer hourly or daily forecasts for the past several years.\\n\\nRemember to dress appropriately for the weather and check local weather reports for any potential hazards, such as strong winds or flash floods, before engaging in outdoor activities in the San Francisco area.
